            <p id="takeaway-content">In slide 1, we see the comparison of male and female scores across three different categories: math, reading, and writing. Both gender groups are of a similar size for the sample taken, and these scores are averaged. Highlighting over each bar will reveal more statistical information. However we can see, in aggregate that male students performed best in mathematics, comparatively better than female students. On the contrary, female students had a tendency to do better than male students in both reading and writing as a whole.</p>
